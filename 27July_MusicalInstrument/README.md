For this assignment, I decided to create an instrument that would be fun to use during prayers. In the beginning, I wanted to use a bell and use the servo to hit the bell so that it would make sound, but I didn't know what to do with the buttons. I then realized that I could make the buttons be used as a keyboard to play the notes for a specific chant! Right now, I am using the buttons to play the notes A, G, B, and C, which can be used to play the melody of the "Hare Krishna Hare Rama" chant. I decided to do this because I thought it would be fun for me and my family to play with, because my family is quite religious. 

The instrument works like so: when the user presses the buttons, the notes are played by the piezo buzzer, and when the user covers the light sensor or gets near it, the servo moves and rings the bell.

Something that I had trouble with at first was getting the notes to play. In the beginning, I was unable to figure out why the notes weren't playing when I pressed the button, as I had set the frequencies to the correct notes, and the proper variables as well. I then realized that when the buttons weren't pressed, I had to stop playing a sound and reset it. 

Something I had fun with this assignment was finding the correct notes for the tune! It was very fun for me to experiment and figure out the tune with the buttons.
