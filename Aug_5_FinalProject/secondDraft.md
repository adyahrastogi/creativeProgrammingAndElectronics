## Second Draft of Final Project

For my final project, I plan to make generative art with some human input from arduino sensors. For the art, I will be drawing a tree/plant on the screen using Processing that continues to grow as time passes, and grows upon the previous shapes/locations of the branches or leaves. To make it interactive, I will be using buttons, a photoresistor, and a potentiometer. As of now, I plan to use 1 button to switch between what the input values of the potentiometer controls (like size of branches/how many branches, or color). The other button will be used as a mode where the computer draws the drawing on its own, without taking into consideration the sensor values. Finally, the photoresistor will be used to control transparency or hue, and the potentiometer will control angle/how many branches there are, or based on the button mode, the color of the plant. Something that I do not know about is the algorithm for actually creating expansive drawings, however, I looked up examples of similar styles of art, and there are some helpful websites/tutorials that I can use as a reference to get started on creating the algorithm to make the drawing move based on previous locations and through memory.
