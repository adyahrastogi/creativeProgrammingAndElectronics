## Speaker Notes

Slide 1: 
- Presentation on Andy Lomas 

Slide 2:
- About Andy Lomas
- Andy Lomas is a Computational Artist and a Mathematician, and his art is considered Generative Art
- Currently, he is based in London and lectures in Creative Computing at Goldsmiths at University of London. He also works on his art projects as well as lecturing.
- His art has been displayed and kept in many exhibitions, some that even solely feature his artwork. 
- Andy Lomas is also an Emmy award winning supervisor of computer generated effects (CGI)

Slide 3:
- These are some of very many exhibits that Andy Lomas' art has been displayed in, and you can click the link for a complete list of the exhibits 
- Before becoming a Computational Artist, he has worked on the CGI of many popular movies, like the Matrix movies and the Avatar movie
- He has also won several awards: 
  - Emmy awards for The Odyssey, the 1997 television miniseries, as well as for the 1999 Alice in Wonderland film
  - Won the Lumen Prize Gold Award in 2014 for his work, Cellular Forms

Slide 4:
- This is a video clip that shows his project, Cellular Forms  

Slide 5:
- Andy Lomas' Art falls under the category of generative artwork, which is art that has been created using computer systems by a program
- To create complex 3D models, he simulates natural growth processes like that of cells, through aggregation.
- His works use Diffuse-Limited Aggregation, which essentially simulates growth by repeatedly growing the figures by building upon the previous shapes/locations over time, which adds complexity
- Another cool thing in his artwork that I found was that his programs use deep learning and neural networks to understand what is considered aesthetic, so that the program can understand what is aesthetic without human input
- These are some of his projects: 
(Vase Forms, Mutant Vase Forms, Hybrid Forms, Plantlike Forms, Cellular Forms, Flow, Growth by Aggregation) which I will show in the next few slides

Slide 6:
- His work Vase Forms
- Here, he used constraints to generate vase structures that can be made into physical structures, which are shown on the left
- On the right are vase like structures that have been generated using different environment constraints, but cannot be made into physical structures

Slide 7:
- The Hybrid Forms work of his is a 360 degree project, and 4 different angles of the same object can be seen in the video 
- This project uses more than one kind of cell type, which is seen in the video when the different shapes/forms fight for space as time passes

Slide 8:
- In his Plantlike project, the plants grow from the bottom up based on the amount of light the cell receives, simulating plant growth

Slide 9:
- Similar to the rest of his artwork, the aggregation artwork is based on mathematical rules and starts with a simple seed which branches out and becomes more complex by building upon several layers 

Slide 10:
- This is Andy Lomas' website, which I used as a reference
