## Final Project First Draft

For my final project, I have been thinking of creating art using Processing and Arduino. I am thinking of doing a project on generative art and making digital art as plants/nature/trees as the main subject of the art where the natural art grows upon the previously drawn shapes as time passes. I would like to use communication between Arduino and Processing to vary the direction, size, amounts of branches/plant material, color, and perhaps more parameters. As of now, I plan to at least the following: buttons, photoresistor, potentiometer.
